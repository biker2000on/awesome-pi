# Awesome PI 

This resource is a large collection of links on the many resources, tutorials, knowledge-base and other articles about the OSIsoft PI System. The PI System is built from many parts but the heart of the system is the NoSQL time series database, the PI Data Archive. On top of that are a SQL mapper and analytics engine, PI Asset Framework, and then many other data visualization, gathering, and analysis technologies. 

This repository is an attempt to aggregate the best/most useful resources together. A lot of it is directly from the OSIsoft forums.
